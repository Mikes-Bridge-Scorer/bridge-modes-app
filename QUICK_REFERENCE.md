## ⭐ Bonus Bridge (Full)

**Philosophy:** Both sides score on every hand. Skill over luck!

**Key Concepts:**
- Raw score ÷ 15 = base points
- Adjusted by HCP vs expected for contract level
- Distribution helps suit contracts, hurts NT
- Defenders always get 1-4 points minimum

**Expected HCP by Contract:**
- Part scores (1-2 level): 21 HCP
- 3NT: 25 HCP | 3M: 23 HCP | 3m: 24 HCP
- 4M: 24 HCP | 4m: 26 HCP
- 5m: 27 HCP
- Small Slam (6): 30 HCP
- Grand Slam (7): 32 HCP

**Distribution Points:**
- Singleton = 2 pts
- Void = 3 pts
- Long suit (6+) = 1 pt
- *NT: Negative impact from voids/singletons*

**Defender Rewards:**
- Baseline: 1-2 points
- Extra if declarer underperforms hand potential
- Extra if defending against strong hand (>25 HCP)
